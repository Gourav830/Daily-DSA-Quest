# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Find pairs with given sum in doubly linked list

## STATEMENT 

A doubly-linked list is a data structure that consists of sequentially linked nodes, and the nodes have reference to both the previous and the next nodes in the sequence of nodes.<br>

You are given a sorted doubly linked list of size 'n', consisting of distinct positive integers, and a number 'k'.<br>

Find out all the pairs in the doubly linked list with sum equal to 'k'.

## Constraints

* 2 <= 'n' <= 10 ^ 4
* 1 <= 'data' in any node <= 10 ^ 4
* 1 <= 'k' <= 10 ^ 4
