# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Satisfying Constraints

## STATEMENT 

Alex is solving a problem. He has n constraints on what the integer k can be. There are three types of constraints:
1. k must be greater than or equal to some integer x;
2. k must be less than or equal to some integer x;
3. k must be not equal to some integer x.

Help Alex find the number of integers k that satisfy all n constraints. It is guaranteed that the answer is finite (there exists at least one constraint of type 1 and at least one constraint of type 2). Also, it is guaranteed that no two constraints are the exact same.

## Constraints

* 1 <= ‘T’ <= 500
* 2 ≤ n ≤ 100
* 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^9
