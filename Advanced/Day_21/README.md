# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Replacing Elements

## STATEMENT 

You have an array a1,a2,…,an. All ai are positive integers.

In one step you can choose three distinct indices i, j, and k (i≠j; i≠k; j≠k) and assign the sum of aj and ak to ai, i. e. make ai=aj+ak. <br>

Can you make all ai lower or equal to d using the operation above any number of times (possibly, zero)?

## Constraints

* 1 ≤ t ≤ 2000
* 3 ≤ n ≤ 100
* 1 ≤ d ≤ 100
* 1 ≤ ai ≤ 100
