# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I

## STATEMENT 
You are given a string s that consists of lowercase English letters.<br>

A string is called special if it is made up of only a single character. For example, the string "abc" is not special, whereas the strings "ddd", "zz", and "f" are special.<br>

Return the length of the longest special substring of s which occurs at least thrice, or -1 if no special substring occurs at least thrice.<br>

A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.

## Constraints

3 <= s.length <= 50<br>
s consists of only lowercase English letters.
