# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Balanced Round

## STATEMENT 

You are the author of a Codeforces round and have prepared n problems you are going to set, problem i having difficulty ai. You will do
the following process:<br>

. remove some (possibly zero) problems from the list;<br>
. rearrange the remaining problems in any order you wish.<br>

A round is considered balanced if and only if the absolute difference between the difficulty of any two consecutive problems is at most k
(less or equal than k).<br>

What is the minimum number of problems you have to remove so that an arrangement of problems is balanced?

## Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 1000
* 1 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5
* 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9
* 1 ≤ ai ≤ 10^9
