# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Milica and String

## STATEMENT 
Milica has a string s of length n, consisting only of characters A and B. She wants to modify s so it contains exactly k instances of B. In one operation, she can do the following:<br>
Select an integer i (1≤i≤n) and a character c (c is equal to either A or B). <br>
Then, replace each of the first i characters of string s (that is, characters s1,s2 …,si) with c.<br>
Milica does not want to perform too many operations in order not to waste too much time on them.<br>
She asks you to find the minimum number of operations required to modify s so it contains exactly k instances of B. She also wants you to find these operations (that is, integer i and character c selected in each operation).
