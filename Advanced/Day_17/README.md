# PROBLEM OF THE DAY :  Rotate Matrix

## STATEMENT 

Given a 2-dimensional matrix of size ‘N’ x ‘M’, rotate the elements of the matrix clockwise.<br>

For example: <br>
Input Matrix: 
<br> [ [ 1, 2, 3 ] <br>
                [ 4, 5, 6 ] <br>
                [ 7, 8, 9 ] ]<br>

Output Matrix: <br> [ [ 4, 1, 2 ] 
                 [ 7, 5, 3 ] 
                 [ 8, 9, 6 ] ]<br>

The output matrix is generated by rotating the elements of the input matrix in a clockwise direction. Note that every element is rotated only once. <br>
Note :<br>
You do not need to print anything; it has already been taken care of. Also, update the given matrix in-place.

## Constraints

* 1 <= T <= 10
* 1 <= N, M <= 100
* -10^5 <= data <= 10^5,
