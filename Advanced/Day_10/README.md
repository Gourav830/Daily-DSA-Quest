# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Special Subarray

## STATEMENT 
You are given an array ‘ARR’ of size ‘N’. Your task is to find the special subarray of ‘ARR’. A special subarray is the smallest contiguous part of an array that contains all the occurrences of the most frequent element of the array.<br>

For example:<br>
You are given ‘ARR’ = {1, 3, 4, 3, 5}. Then our answer will be {3, 4, 3} because the most frequent element is 3, and the subarray {3, 4, 3} contains all the occurrences of 3.

## Constraints
1 <= T <= 10 <br>
1 <= N  <= 5000<br>
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10 ^ 6
