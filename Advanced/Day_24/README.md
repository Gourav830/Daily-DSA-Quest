# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Non-Decreasing Array

## STATEMENT 

You have been given an integer array/list 'ARR' of size 'N'. Write a solution to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.<br>

We define an array as non-decreasing, if ARR[i] <= ARR[i + 1] holds for every i (0-based) such that (0 <= i <= N - 2).

## Constraints

* 1 <= T <= 50
* 1 <= N <= 10 ^ 4
* - 10 ^ 9 <= ARR[i] <= 10 ^ 9
