# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Flatten Binary Tree to Linked List

## STATEMENT 

Given the root of a binary tree, flatten the tree into a "linked list":<br>
. The "linked list" should use the same TreeNode class where the
right child pointer points to the next node in the list and the
left child pointer is always null.<br>

. The "linked list" should be in the same order as a pre-order
traversal of the binary tree.<br>

## Constraints
* The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 2000]

* -100 <= Node.val <= 100
