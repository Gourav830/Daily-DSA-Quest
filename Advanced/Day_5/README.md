# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : United We Stand

## STATEMENT 

Given an array a of length n, containing integers. And there are two initially empty arrays b and c. You need to add each element of array a
to exactly one of the arrays b or c, in order to satisfy the following conditions:<br>

. Both arrays b and c are non-empty. More formally, let l be the length of array b, and lc be the length of array c. Then l, lc ≥ 1.<br>
· For any two indices i and j (1 < i ≤ 1b, 1 ≤ j ≤lc), cj is not a divisor of bi.<br>
Output the arrays b and c that can be obtained, or output -1 if they do not exist.

## Constraints

* (2≤n≤100)
* (1≤ai≤10^9)
