# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Array Rearrangment

## STATEMENT 

The first line of input contains one integer t -the number of test cases. t blocks follow, each describing an individual test
case.<br>

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x - the length of arrays a and b, and the
parameter x, described in the problem statement.<br>

The second line of each test case contains n integers a1, a2, ... , an (1 < a1 ≤ a2 <... < n ≤ x) -the elements of array a in non-
descending order.<br>

The third line of each test case contains n integers b1, b2, ... , bn (1 ≤ b1 ≤ b2 ≤ ... < bn ≤ x) - the elements of array b in non-
descending order.<br>

Test cases are separated by a blank line.

## Constraints

* 1 < n < 50
* 1 < x < 1000
* 1 < t < 100
