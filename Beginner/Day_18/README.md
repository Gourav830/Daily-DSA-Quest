# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Minimum Sum Subarray Of Given Size

## STATEMENT 

You have been given an array 'ARR' of integers consisting of ‘N’ integers and a positive integer ‘K’. Your task is to find a subarray(contiguous) of size ‘K’ such that the sum of its elements is minimum.<br>

Note :<br>
You can assume that the value of ‘K’ will always be less than or equal to ‘N’. So, the answer will always exist.

## Constraints

* 1 <= N <=  10^5
* 1 <= K <= N 
* -10^5 <= ARR[i] <= 10^5
