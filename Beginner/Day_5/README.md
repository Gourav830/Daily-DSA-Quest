# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Set Matrix Zeros

## STATEMENT 

Given an ‘N’ x ‘M’ integer matrix, if an element is 0, set its entire row and column to 0's, and return the matrix. In particular, your task is to modify it in such a way that if a cell has a value 0 (matrix[i][j] == 0), then all the cells of the ith row and jth column should be changed to 0.
<br>
You must do it in place.<br>

For Example:<br>

If the given grid is this:<br>
[7, 19, 3]<br>
[4, 21, 0]<br>

Then the modified grid will be:<br>
[7, 19, 0]<br>
[0, 0,  0]
