# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Maximum Difference

## STATEMENT 

You are given an array 'ARR' of the 'N' element. Your task is to find the maximum difference between any of the two elements from 'ARR'.<br>

If the maximum difference is even print “EVEN” without quotes. If the maximum difference is odd print “ODD” without quotes.<br>

For example:<br>

Given 'ARR' = [1, 10, 5, 2, 8, 1 ] , answer is "ODD".<br>
Here the maximum difference is between 10 and 1, 10 - 1 = 9

## Constraints

* 1 <= T <= 100
* 1 <= N <= 5000 
* 1 <= ARR[i] <= 10 ^ 9
