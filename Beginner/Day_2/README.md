# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Binary Search 

## STATEMENT 

You are given an integer array 'A' of size 'N', sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer 'target'.<br>
Your task is to write a function to search for 'target' in the array 'A'. If it exists, return its index in 0-based indexing. If 'target' is not present in the array 'A', return -1.<br>

Note:<br>
You must write an algorithm whose time complexity is O(LogN)

## Input Format
The first line contains an Integer 'N', which denotes the size of the array/list.<br>

The second line contains 'N' single space-separated integers representing the
elements in the array/list.<br>

The third line contains the value of 'target' to be searched for in the array/list

## Output Format
Return the index at which 'target' is present for each test case, -1 otherwise.
