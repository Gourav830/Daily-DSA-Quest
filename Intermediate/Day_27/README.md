# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Don't Try to Count

## STATEMENT 

Given a string x of length n and a string s of length m (n . m < 25), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, you can apply any number of
operations to the string x.<br>

In one operation, you append the current value of x to the end of the string x. Note that the value of x will change after this.<br>

For example, if x ="aba", then after applying operations, x will change as follows: "aba" -> "abaaba" -> "abaabaabaaba".<br>

After what minimum number of operations s will appear in x as a substring? A substring of a string is defined as a contiguous segment of
it.

## Constraints

* 1 ≤ T ≤ 10^4
* 1 ≤ n * m ≤ 25
