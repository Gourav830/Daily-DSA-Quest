# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Dominant Element

## STATEMENT 
You are given an array A of length N. An element X is said to be dominant if the frequency of X in A is strictly greater than the frequency of any other element in the A.<br>

For example, if A = [2, 1, 4, 4, 4] then 4 is a dominant element since its frequency is higher than the frequency of any other element in A.<br>

Find if there exists any dominant element in A.
