# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Top K Frequent Elements

## STATEMENT 

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return the k most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

## Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 10^5<br>
-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4<br>
k is in the range [1, the number of unique elements in the array].<br>
It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.<br>
Your algorithm's time complexity must be better than O(n log n), where n is the array's size.
