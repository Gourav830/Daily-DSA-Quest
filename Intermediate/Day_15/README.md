# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays

## STATEMENT 

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of sizes n and m, respectively.<br>

Consider calculating the following values:<br>

* The number of indices i such that 0 <= i < n and nums1[i] occurs at least once in nums2.
* The number of indices i such that 0 <= i < m and nums2[i] occurs at least once in nums1.
Return an integer array answer of size 2 containing the two values in the above order.

## Constraints

* n == nums1.length
* m == nums2.length
* 1 <= n, m <= 100
* 1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100
