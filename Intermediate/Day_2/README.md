# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Sort 0 1 2

## STATEMENT 
You have been given an integer array/list(ARR) of size 'N'. It only contains 0s, 1s and 2s. Write a solution to sort this array/list.<br>
Note :<br>
Try to solve the problem in 'Single Scan'. ' Single Scan' refers to iterating over the array/list just once or to put it in other words, you will be visiting each element in the array/list just once.

## Input Format
The first line contains an integer 'T' which denotes the number of test cases or
queries to be run. Then the test cases follow.<br>
The first line of each test case contains an Integer 'N' denoting the size of the
array/list.<br>
The second line of each test case contains 'N' space-separated Integers
denoting the array/list.<br>
## Output Format
For each test case/query, print the sorted array/list(ARR) as space-separated
Integers.<br>

Output for every test case will be printed in a separate line.
