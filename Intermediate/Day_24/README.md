# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Oath of the Night's Watch
## STATEMENT 

"Night gathers, and now my watch begins. It shall not end until my death. I shall take no wife, hold no lands, father no children. I shall wear
no crowns and win no glory. I shall live and die at my post. I am the sword in the darkness. I am the watcher on the walls. I am the shield
that guards the realms of men. I pledge my life and honor to the Night's Watch, for this night and all the nights to come." - The Night's
Watch oath.<br>

With that begins the watch of Jon Snow. He is assigned the task to support the stewards.<br>

This time he has n stewards with him whom he has to provide support. Each steward has his own strength. Jon Snow likes to support a
steward only if there exists at least one steward who has strength strictly less than him and at least one steward who has strength strictly
greater than him.<br>

Can you find how many stewards will Jon support?
