# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Product of Array Except Self

## STATEMENT 

Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].<br>
The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.<br>
You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

## Constraints

* 2 <= nums.length <= 10^5
* -30 <= nums[i] <= 30
