# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

## STATEMENT 

You are given an array 'arr' of size 'n' having unique elements that has been sorted in ascending order and rotated between 1 and 'n' times which is unknown.<br>

The rotation involves shifting every element to the right, with the last element moving to the first position. For example, if 'arr' = [1, 2, 3, 4] was rotated one time, it would become [4, 1, 2, 3].<br>

Your task is to find the minimum number in this array.<br>
Note :<br>
All the elements in the array are distinct.

## Constraints

* 1 <= arr[i] <= 10^9
* 1 <= n <= 10^5
