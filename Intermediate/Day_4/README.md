# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Unique Bid Auction

## STATEMENT 

Let's simplify this game a bit. Formally, there are n participants, the i-th participant chose the number ai. The winner of the game is such a participant that the number he chose is unique (i. e. nobody else chose this number except him) and is minimal (i. e. among all unique values of a the minimum one is the winning one).<br>

Your task is to find the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Indexing is 1-based, i. e. the participants are numbered from 1 to n <br>
You have to answer t independent test cases.

## Output

For each test case, print the answer â€” the index of the participant who won the game (or -1 if there is no winner). Note that the answer is always unique.
