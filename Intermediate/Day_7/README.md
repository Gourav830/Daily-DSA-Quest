# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Single Number

## STATEMENT 
Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.<br>

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.<br>

## Constraints

1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4
-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4
