# PROBLEM OF THE DAY : Reverse Linked List

## STATEMENT 
There is a string a (unknown to you), consisting of lowercase Latin letters, encrypted according to the following rule into string s:<br>

* after each character of string a, an arbitrary (possibly zero) number of any lowercase Latin letters, different from the character itself, is added.<br>
* after each such addition, the character that we supplemented is added.<br>
You are given string s, and you need to output the initial string a. In other words, you need to decrypt string s. <br>
Note that each string encrypted in this way is decrypted uniquely.

## Constraints

1≤t≤1000<br>
2≤n≤100
